# 📁 Case Study 01 — Sales Force Training Impact Analysis

## 🎯 Objective  
Evaluate whether a sales force training program significantly increased the average transaction amount.

## 📌 Methodology
- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Variance & Standard Deviation
- One Sample T-Test
- Significance Level (α = 0.05)

## 📊 Key Result
- Mean after training: **102.6**
- Hypothesis test p-value: **0.343**
- Decision: **Fail to reject H0**

## 💡 Business Insight
Although the average transaction increased slightly, the improvement is not statistically significant.  

Recommendation:
- Re-evaluate training effectiveness  
- Increase sample size  
- Monitor impact over longer periods
